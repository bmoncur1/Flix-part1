### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I am still working on the collection view. I have been trying to adjust this view, but when I expand it, it doesn't display correctly on the app. It's still a work in progress. I also had a bug in my code which took a while to discover.

### Notes
Overall, all video walkthoughs were very helpful. I did, however, have a difficult time uploading the gif at the end of the project.
